The graphs layout an X and Y axis with variables and ranges from the most desirable to least desirable. For instance, the far right may be listed as 'Upper class' while the left side will be 'Lower Class'. This allows for the placement of business names to help find the position that consumers place these businesses in relation to the variables listed."

data file will reflect in the panel on the left. Now you can navigate across different tab viz. 'PCA Variance Plot' tab, 'JSM plot' tab and 'Data' tab. Sample perceptual file and preference file is shown
