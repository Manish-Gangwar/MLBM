#### Overview & Example Datasets


Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is defined as an [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_transformation) [linear transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_transformation) that transforms the data to a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by some scalar projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.
